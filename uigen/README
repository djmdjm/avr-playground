This is a small program to generate C source file for hierarchical
menus from a small domain-specific language. Usage:

uigen [--template=/path/uidata.c.t] menu.def > output.c

There's some description of the language itself at the start of
parse.y in this directory, but the best example is probably menu.def.

TODO:

- better documentation :)
- (optional?) context argument to get/set functions?
